# Tata Sky IPTV Script generator

A script to generate the m3u playlist containing direct streamable file (.mpd or MPEG-DASH or DASH) based on the channels that the user has subscribed on the Tata Sky portal. You just have to login that's it

## Login 
The figure shows how the API authenticates any user 

**Using OTP**

Password mechanism also works kinda similar

### Explanation of different files used in the code_samples directory

```allChannels.py``` - This generates a file allChannels.json containing all the channels available on the TataSky platform irrespective of whether the user has subscribed or not. The file has already been included in the repository

```constants.py``` - This is a list of urls, headers, payloads that might be used anywhere in the other files

```jwttoken.py``` - 
+ This contains the logic need for generation of the jwt . This is different from the user access Token generated by the backend upon user login. This is needed to get a license to play each channel url / mpeg dash stream /mpd file
The token generated here is appended to the license_url of each channel using ls_session key
You can find how it is done in the detailed manner in the file itself
+ This can be used independently , just specify the channelId for which you need to get the token and you are good to go
The script calls this repeatedly for all channels in the user subscribed/entitlement list

```main.py``` - This contains the logic for the menu generation for the user. It might be updated constantly
```utils.py``` - This contains the logic for the m3u generation. This will be integrated soon in the main file

# How to use

+ Clone this to your directory using ```git clone https://github.com/ForceGT/TSPrivateAPI```

+ Simply run main.py using the following code
```python
  python main.py
```
+ You will get options to login using the different methods, upon successful login a ```userDetails.json``` file is created which contains important details of the user. The ```accessToken``` has to be updated from time to time. To do so run the login logic again

+ You can generate m3u file by selecting option 3. This generates ```allChannelPlaylist.m3u``` file
**NOTE: Please run this only after logging in otherwise the script exits with an error**

+ The generated m3u file may have to be updated time to time. If it fails to get jwt for a specific channelId then you must do it manually. Note down the channelId and then use the ```jwttoken.py``` to generate token for that file and manually edit the m3u file using any text editor


# Playing in Android TV

+ You can use Kodi with the PVR Simple IPTV Plugin. The generated m3u file already is in the standard format that can be read by the plugin
+ You can use Tivimate app to play the m3u playlist too

# Playing in a browser (tried with Chrome)

+ I personally use [Native MPEG-Dash + HLS Playback](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/native-mpeg-dash-%20-hls-pl/cjfbmleiaobegagekpmlhmaadepdeedn) which doesn't suppport playlists yet
+ To play a single file open the generated m3u file, and look for the channel you want to play. Get the channel url (ends with ```.mpd```) and paste it in the browser
+ The extension automatically asks for the license url. You should then look for the license url. The license url is the value of the key ```#KODIPROP:inputstream.adaptive.license_key=``` paramater. Copy the entire url and paste it in the browser
**NOTE:** The ls_session should be copied carefully otherwise the license is not granted
